    <h1>COLDPLAY FAN SITE</h1>
    <h3>About Coldplay</h3>
    <p>Coldplay are a British rock band formed in
        London in 1997. They consist of vocalist and pianist Chris Martin, guitarist Jonny Buckland, bassist Guy Berryman,
        drummer and percussionist Will Champion, and manager Phil Harvey. They are best known for their live performances,and their impact on popular 
        culture through their music, advocacy and achievements. The members of the band initially met at University College London, calling themselves Big Fat Noises and changing to Starfish before the final name.
         After releasing the extended play Safety (1998) independently, they signed with Parlophone in 1999 and issued their debut album, Parachutes (2000), featuring the breakthrough single "Yellow". It earned a Brit Award for British Album of the
          Year and a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album. The group's follow-up,
          A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002), won the same accolades. X&Y (2005) completed what they considered a trilogy. Its successor, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends (2008), received a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album. Both records
           topped the charts in more than 30 countries and became the best-sellers of their respective years globally. Viva la Vida's title track was also the first song by British musicians to reach number one in the United States and United Kingdom simultaneously in the 21st century.</p>
